First Aid: CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)

If someone is unresponsive and not breathing normally:

1. CHECK RESPONSIVENESS
   - Tap shoulders firmly and shout "Are you okay?"
   - Look for normal breathing (don't confuse gasping with normal breathing)

2. CALL FOR HELP
   - Call emergency services immediately (911/112/108)
   - If someone else is present, have them call while you start CPR
   - Get an AED (Automated External Defibrillator) if available

3. START CHEST COMPRESSIONS
   - Place heel of hand on center of chest
   - Place other hand on top, interlocking fingers
   - Keep arms straight, shoulders directly over hands
   - Push hard and fast: at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep
   - Rate: 100-120 compressions per minute
   - Allow full chest recoil between compressions

4. GIVE RESCUE BREATHS (if trained)
   - After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths
   - Tilt head back, lift chin
   - Pinch nose shut, make complete seal over mouth
   - Give breath for 1 second, watching for chest rise
   - If chest doesn't rise, reposition airway and try again

5. CONTINUE CPR
   - Continue cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths
   - Don't stop until:
     * Emergency services arrive
     * Person starts breathing normally
     * AED arrives and is ready to use
     * You are too exhausted to continue

6. USE AED WHEN AVAILABLE
   - Turn on AED and follow voice prompts
   - Attach pads to bare chest as shown
   - Stand clear when AED analyzes rhythm
   - If shock advised, ensure no one is touching person, then press shock button
   - Resume CPR immediately after shock

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- It's better to do something than nothing
- You cannot make situation worse by performing CPR on someone not breathing
- Hands-only CPR (compressions without breaths) is acceptable if you're not trained or unwilling to give breaths
- For children and infants, techniques differ slightly - use one hand for children, two fingers for infants
- Continue CPR until professional help arrives
