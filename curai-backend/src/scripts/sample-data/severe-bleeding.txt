First Aid: Severe Bleeding Control

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR SEVERE BLEEDING:

1. ENSURE SCENE SAFETY
   - Make sure area is safe for you and victim
   - Put on gloves if available (universal precautions)

2. CALL EMERGENCY SERVICES
   - Call 911/112/108 immediately for severe bleeding
   - Stay on line and follow dispatcher instructions

3. APPLY DIRECT PRESSURE
   - Place clean cloth, gauze, or bandage over wound
   - Press firmly and continuously
   - DO NOT lift cloth to check bleeding - add more layers if blood soaks through
   - Maintain pressure for at least 10 minutes
   - Use your hands if no cloth available

4. ELEVATE IF POSSIBLE
   - Raise injured area above heart level if safe to do so
   - DO NOT elevate if you suspect broken bones

5. ADD PRESSURE POINTS (if direct pressure not enough)
   - For arm wounds: press brachial artery (inside of upper arm)
   - For leg wounds: press femoral artery (groin crease)
   - Use pressure points WHILE maintaining direct pressure

6. IF BLEEDING DOESN'T STOP:
   - Apply MORE pressure
   - Consider tourniquet for limb injuries only (last resort)
   - Make note of time tourniquet applied

TOURNIQUET USE (Life-Threatening Limb Bleeding Only):
- Place 2-3 inches above wound, never on joint
- Tighten until bleeding stops completely
- Note time applied and write on victim's forehead or nearby
- DO NOT loosen once applied - only trained personnel should remove
- Modern commercial tourniquets preferred (CAT, SOFT-T)

FOR SPECIFIC WOUNDS:

ABDOMINAL WOUNDS:
- DO NOT remove any objects protruding from wound
- Cover with moist, clean cloth
- Keep victim lying down with knees bent

CHEST WOUNDS:
- Cover with air-tight seal (plastic wrap, bag)
- Tape three sides only (allows air to escape but not enter)
- Victim should sit up if conscious and able

AMPUTATION:
- Save severed part if possible
- Wrap in clean, moist cloth
- Place in plastic bag
- Keep cool (not directly on ice)
- DO NOT place directly in ice or water

SIGNS OF LIFE-THREATENING BLEEDING:
- Blood spurting or pulsing from wound
- Blood pooling on ground
- Clothing soaked with blood
- Bandages soaked through
- Loss of all or part of arm or leg
- Victim confused or unconscious

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT apply direct pressure to eye injury, embedded object, or skull fracture
- DO NOT remove embedded objects (stabilize them instead)
- DO NOT use tourniquet unless life-threatening and other methods fail
- DO NOT give anything by mouth
- DO NOT move victim unnecessarily

PREVENTION OF SHOCK:
- Keep victim lying down
- Cover with blanket to maintain warmth
- Do not give food or drink
- Reassure and keep calm
