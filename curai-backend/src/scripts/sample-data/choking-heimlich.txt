   - Wrap arms around waist
   - Make fist with one hand, place thumb side against stomach just above navel
   - Grasp fist with other hand
   - Give quick, upward thrusts into abdomen
   - Each thrust should be separate and forceful
   - Continue until object is dislodged or person becomes unconscious

3. IF PERSON BECOMES UNCONSCIOUS:
   - Lower them to ground carefully
   - Call emergency services if not already done
   - Begin CPR starting with chest compressions
